/**
 * Binary Tree Longest Consecutive Sequence
 *
 * Given a binary tree, find the length of the longest consecutive sequence path.
 * The path refers to any sequence of nodes from some starting node to any node in the tree along the parent-child connections. 
 * The longest consecutive path need to be from parent to child (cannot be the reverse).
 *
 * Definition for a binary tree node.

 *     TreeNode right;
 *     TreeNode(int x) { val = x; }
